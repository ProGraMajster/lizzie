# Lizzie Documentation

This directory contains reference material for the Lizzie scripting language.

- [Introduction and reference guide](introduction.md)

Additional examples and usage information are available in the [project README](../README.md).

The introduction covers core language features including typed variable
declarations using `var(@name, type, value)` and the host memory functions
`host-var`, `host-set` and `host-del` which allow values to persist across script
invocations.
